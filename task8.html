<h1>Task 8: Auto-Fit, Minmax & Responsive Grid — Answers</h1>

<div class="container">

    <div class="item">
        1. What problem does auto-fit solve?<br>
        auto-fit fills the row with as many items as possible and moves the rest to the next row automatically.
    </div>

    <div class="item">
        2. Why is minmax important?<br>
        minmax sets a minimum width so items don’t shrink too small and a maximum width so they can expand.
    </div>

    <div class="item">
        3. Do items shrink too much?<br>
        No, minmax prevents extreme shrinking by enforcing a minimum size.
    </div>

    <div class="item">
        4. Is this layout mobile friendly?<br>
        Yes, number of columns reduces on small screens without breaking.
    </div>

    <div class="item">
        5. Why are media queries not needed here?<br>
        Because responsive behavior is handled automatically through minmax and auto-fit.
